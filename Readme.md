##	AdVoice MusicStore

  The ÃœberSnip AdVoice Music Store is an effort to mitigate corporations. The royalties of musicians should be paid 100% to the aritst, so, we've started building a store that will allow that. Additionally, this Music Store is especially targeted to Indie Record labels looking to manage, grow, and sell their musicians music. Together, we can take back the indie artist community.
